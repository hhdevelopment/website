## Installation

Installing `ARCHWAY` is very easy, the `ARCHWAY` application requires 2 `docker` images. The `ARCHWAY` image and the `mongodb` image.

:::tip
Note that the `mongodb` database can be clustered (in swarm or k8s), but more importantly, it can be used by your microservices to store your documents.
:::

:::warning
However, it is not recommended to access and especially modify `ARCHWAY` documents via your internal services. This is what we call data governance.
:::

The best way to install `ARCHWAY` is to deploy it within a cluster. But you can also install it as a simple `docker` container via `docker-compose`.

### `docker-compose.yml` File

<details>
  <summary>`docker-compose.yml`</summary>
```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3.8'
services:
  archway:
    image: ghcr.io/softwarity/archway:latest
    ports:
      - 8080:8080 # non HTTPS
    environment:
      MONGODB_HOST: mongodb 
      MONGODB_DB_NAME: archway
      MONGODB_USER: admin
      MONGODB_PWD: changeit
    networks:
      - net

  mongodb:
    image: mongo # official image  
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: archway
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: changeit
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db
    networks:
      - net

volumes:
  mongodb_data:

networks:
  net:
```
</details>

:::tip
Note that the mongodb_data volume does not have a specific destination specified and will therefore be managed by docker.
See [volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) for more details.

:::tip
Note that in the absence of a certificate, HTTPS is not active by default.
[See Enable `HTTPS`](conf/https)
:::

### `docker-compose`

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### `cluster` `Swarm`

In this example, we will launch `ARCHWAY` in a stack named `myapp`.

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml myapp
```

### `cluster` `Kubernetes`

To deploy `ARCHWAY` in a kube cluster, it is necessary to use other deployment files.
