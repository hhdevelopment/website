:::info
`ARCHWAY` is built on proven technologies.
:::

## `Back-end`

The `back-end` relies on the `Spring` ecosystem, particularly `Spring Cloud Gateway`.

`Spring Cloud Gateway` is a dynamic `API gateway` for microservices.
It is built on `Spring Framework` and `Spring Boot`, providing an easy way to create `API` routing.
`Spring Cloud Gateway` is often used in microservices-based architectures to efficiently manage requests between different services.

## `Front-end`

The `front-end` relies on the `Angular` ecosystem.
`Angular` and `Material Angular` are primarily used in the user interface.

`Angular` is a front-end development framework based on TypeScript, developed and maintained by `Google`.

`Angular Material` is a `UI` component library for `Angular`, following the principles of `Google`'s `Material Design`.

## `Database`

For the database, we have chosen `MongoDB`.

`MongoDB` is a document-oriented `NoSQL` database, very popular for its flexibility and performance.
